# OpenBaybayin

OpenBaybayin is a font primarily made to accompany my Unicode proposal, *[The baybayin “ra”—ᜍ: its origins and a plea for its formal recognition](https://github.com/ctrlcctrlv/OpenBaybayin/blob/master/tex/ra/merge.pdf)*.

# Font information

This font most closely conforms to Norman de los Santos' version of *baybayin*. I included many forms of “ra”; the generic form is at U+170D and the Zambales form is available if Historical Forms (`hist`) is enabled. The others are in the Private Usea Area.

Also included:
* An alternate `x` shaped *virama*
* A *padalawa* (U+E000) and a *pahantig* (U+E002)
* A *pallawa* (U+1A1E)
* A *pamudpod* (U+1734)
* An alternate hollow *kudlit* can be attained in compliant programs by using U+FE00, VARIATION SELECTOR-1.
* A *danda* (U+1735) and double *danda* (U+1736) are available if you want to use *baybayin* punctuation when writing *baybayin* texts.

Rules for the usage of all of the above can be found on [Norman de los Santos' blog](http://nordenx.blogspot.com), in the articles *[Modern Baybáyin Chart](http://nordenx.blogspot.com/2012/07/modern-baybayin-chart.html)* and *[Worth Repeating](http://nordenx.blogspot.com/2014/12/worth-repeating.html)*
